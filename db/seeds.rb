# development, test). The code here should be idempotent so that it can be executed at any point in every environment.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Example:

# ðŸ”´ solved problem! --> poster_url for API wasn't working until we inserted the Movie.destroy all:
# REASON?: This approach effectively resets the database to a clean state before inserting new data,
# preventing conflicts with existing records and ensuring data integrity.

# puts "******* only first url here"
# peli = Movie.first
# p peli.poster_url

puts "Finished! Total of #{MoviesArray.count} movies created!"
